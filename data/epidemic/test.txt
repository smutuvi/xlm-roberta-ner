If O

But O
India B-LOC
still O
remains O
at O
serious O
risk O
of O
fresh O

if O
the O

is O
brought O
back O
into O
the O

from O

, O
and O

experts O
say O
the O
country O
' O

massive O
immunisation O

must O
be O
maintained O
. O

' O
' O
This O
has O
been O
a O
monumental O
effort O

' O
' O
said O
Hamid O

of O
the O
World O

National O
Polio O
Surveillance O
Project O
in O
India B-LOC

' O
' O
From O
a O
global O
perspective O
, O
India B-LOC
was O
a O
major O
source O
of O
the O
international O
spread O
of O
wild O
polio B-DIS
virus O
over O
past O
decades O
… O
but O
, O
also O
, O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
excuse O
that O
polio B-DIS
cannot O
be O
eradicated O
. O

If O
it O
can O
be O
eradicated O
in O
India B-LOC
, O
it O
can O
be O
done O
anywhere O
. O
' O
' O

The O
global O
polio B-DIS
eradication O
program O
was O
now O
being O
set O
up O
on O
an O
' O
' O
emergency O
operations O
framework O
' O
' O
, O
Dr O
Jafari O
told O
the O
Herald O
. O

' O
' O
The O
progress O
in O
India B-LOC
had O
given O
impetus O
to O
that O
. O

Now O
very O
few O
countries O
remain O
and O
within O
that O
emergency O
operations O
framework O
, O
they O
are O
really O
looking O
at O
interrupting O
transmission O
within O
18 O
to O
24 O
months O
, O
certainly O
within O
2013 O
. O
' O
' O

Just O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
experts O
were O
stating O
polio B-DIS
could O
never O
be O
eradicated O
from O
India B-LOC
. O

In O
2009 O
, O
India B-LOC
accounted O
for O
half O
the O
world O
' O
s O
polio B-DIS
cases O
with O
741 O
reported O
. O

The O
country O
is O
an O
ideal O
breeding O
ground O
for O
the O
virus O
, O
with O
a O
massive O
and O
growing O
poor O
population O
, O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
people O
living O
in O
close O
proximity O
with O
poor O
sanitation O
, O
and O
a O
monsoon O
season O
in O
the O
north O
that O
helps O
the O
virus O
flourish O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
health O

is O
weak O

and O
health O
services O
for O
the O
poorest O
children O
, O
those O
most O
at O
risk O
of O
polio B-DIS
, O
are O
almost O
non O

The O
push O
to O
eradicate O
polio B-DIS
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
country O
' O

largest O
public O
health O
initiatives O

India B-LOC
now O
consumes O
half O

1 O

The O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
' O
s O
assistant O
director O
general O
for O
polio B-DIS
, O
Bruce O
Aylward O
, O
said O
the O
significance O
of O
India B-LOC
moving O
towards O
being O
declared O
polio B-DIS
free O
three O
years O
without O
an O
outbreak O
' O
' O
is O
a O
huge O
milestone O
which O
almost O
can O
' O
t O
be O
overstated O
' O
' O
. O

But O
he O
said O
the O
remaining O
endemic O
countries O
faced O
different O
challenges O
to O
India B-LOC
. O

In O
Nigeria O
, O
there O
remain O
pockets O
of O
resistance O
to O
the O
vaccine O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
it O
causes O
infertility O
, O
while O
the O
violence O
in O
Afghanistan O
and O
Pakistan O
means O
vaccinators O
can O
' O
t O
safely O
get O
to O
children O
, O
particularly O
those O
who O
live O
in O
restive O
border O
areas O
. O

But O
Dr O
Aylward O
said O
another O
country O
, O
perhaps O
another O
continent O
, O
could O
be O
free O
of O
endemic O
polio B-DIS
by O
the O
end O
of O
this O
year O
. O

' O
' O
If O
we O
can O
truly O
apply O
the O
lessons O
of O
India B-LOC
globally O
and O
the O
political O
will O
is O
truly O
there O

you O

going O

off O

this O

' O
' O
That O
means O
getting O
Nigeria O

stopped O
this O

' O
' O
The O

this O
done O
