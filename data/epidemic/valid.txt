Jeffrey O

that O

be O

They O

the O

" O
says O
Shaman O
. O

" O
Our O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
La O

sets O
the O
stage O
for O
these O

by O
reshuffling O
the O

before O
the O

Research O
shows O
that O
the O

alters O
the O
migration O
, O
stopover O
time O
, O
fitness O
and O
interspecies O

These O

“ O

pain O
relieving O
drugs O
if O
the O
child O
is O

the O

said O
such O
drugs O
might O
erode O
the O
lining O
of O
the O

By O
nature O
, O
these O

also O

Dr O

LakKumar O
Fernando O
who O
is O

said O
that O
looking O
at O
the O
trend O
last O
year O
, O
usually O
among O
those O
affected O
by O
dengue B-DIS
about O
50 O
% O
would O
be O
children O

Last O
year O
, O
among O
the O
dengue B-DIS
deaths O
, O
one O
third O
comprised O
children O
and O
two O
third O
adults O
. O

Adding O
his O
voice O
to O
the O
serious O
concerns O
expressed O
over O
the O
use O
of O
NSAIDs O
when O
dengue B-DIS
is O
rampant O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
guidelines O
for O
dengue B-DIS
management O
formally O
introduced O
by O
the O
Health O
Ministry O
in O
December O
2010 O
specifically O
advised O
against O
their O
use O
. O

If O
any O
child O
has O
fever O
, O
the O
first O
assumption O
should O
be O
that O
it O
is O
dengue B-DIS
, O
as O
this O
viral O
disease O
is O
now O
hyper O
endemic O
in O
Sri B-LOC
Lanka I-LOC
, O
he O
says O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
if O
we O
saw O
10 O
children O
with O
fever O
, O
about O
2 O
3 O
would O
be O
dengue B-DIS
patients O
. O

But O
now O
in O
Colombo O
, O
of O
10 O
children O
with O
fever O
, O
we O
should O
suspect O
that O
five O
have O
dengue B-DIS
, O
while O
in O
Negombo O
it O
would O
be O
as O
high O
as O
eight O

who O
is O

Being O
part O
of O
a O
team O
which O
has O
studied O
dengue B-DIS
management O
not O
only O
in O
Thailand O
but O
also O
helped O
implement O
such O
measures O
in O
Pakistan O
recently O
, O
he O
said O
that O
when O
called O
upon O
to O
advise O
paediatricians O
all O
over O
the O
country O
on O
managing O
very O
ill O
children O
he O
had O
come O
across O
many O
who O
had O
bled O
due O
to O
being O
given O
either O
ibuprofen O
or O
mefenamic O
acid O
before O
admission O
to O
hospital O
. O

“ O
When O
dengue B-DIS
is O
around O
us O
, O
don’t O
give O
NSAIDs O
to O
bring O
down O
the O
fever O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
even O
though O
fever O
could O
be O
a O
distressing O
symptom O
and O
parents O
may O
look O
for O
quick O
relief O
. O

For O
, O
NSAIDs O
would O
then O
do O
more O
harm O
than O
good O
. O

Explaining O
that O
dengue B-DIS
patients O
die O
due O
to O
prolonged O
shock O
, O
fluid O
overload O
or O
massive O
bleeding O
, O
Dr O
. O
Fernando O
added O
the O
cause O
of O
death O
in O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
patients O
was O
massive O
