Unemployed O
doorman O
Alexis O
Rodriguez O
couldn’t O
believe O
his O
eyes O
when O
he O
opened O
an O
envelope O
from O
Bronx B-LOC
Lebanon O
Hospital O
last O
week O
and O
saw O
what O
he O
appeared O
to O
owe O
. O

“ O
I O
almost O
had O
an O
asthma O
attack O
, O
” O
said O
Rodriguez O
, O
28 O
, O
just O
one O
of O
several O

patients O
to O
receive O
absurdly O
inflated O

because O
of O
a O

His O

was O

that O
in O
reality O
amounted O
to O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
300 O
. O

Initially O
, O
Rodriguez O
panicked O
because O
he O
had O
spent O
three O
weeks O
in O
the O
hospital O
with O
pneumonia B-DIS
in O
the O
spring O
and O
knew O
he O
had O
to O
pay O
part O
of O
the O
$ O
40,000 O
cost O
. O

But O
he O
quickly O
realized O
the O
terrifying O
invoice O
couldn’t O
be O
right O
. O

He O
called O
the O
billing O
company O
and O
found O
out O
he O
wasn’t O
the O
only O
one O
with O

shock O

said O
it O
was O

that O

put O
the O

“ O

The O

that O
even O
though O
no O

was O
done O
to O
his O

the O

him O

he O
said O

“ O
I O

Thailand O
had O
laws O

A O

Capacity O
building O
among O

, O
she O
added O
, O
was O
also O
very O

. O

“ O
Nurses O
should O
be O

in O
ways O
to O
judge O
which O

They O
have O
achieved O
this O
in O

, O
” O
she O

She O
also O
proposed O
an O
online O
system O
to O
guide O

that O

had O
to O
live O
with O

some O

The O
goal O
, O
she O
said O
, O
was O
to O
reduce O
dengue B-DIS

mortality O
and O
morbidity O
. O

She O
said O
that O
primary O
health O

system O
should O
be O

“ O
There O
should O
be O
a O

“ O
The O
outcomes O

The O

Professor O
Alan O
Cowman O
from O

says O
counterfeit O
anti O
malarial O
drugs O
are O
not O
only O
potentially O
harmful O
to O
the O
individuals O
who O
consume O
them O
, O
but O
may O
also O
help O
the O
malaria B-DIS
parasite O
develop O
an O
immunity O
to O
artemisinin O
. O

" O
What O
the O
counterfeiters O
have O
done O
is O
basically O
watered O
down O
the O
level O
of O
drug O
in O
the O
tablet O
and O
then O
they O
' O
ve O
added O
in O
other O
things O
that O
will O
have O
no O
effect O
against O
that O
malaria B-DIS
parasite O
, O
" O
said O
Professor O
Cowman O
, O
one O
of O
Australia O
' O
s O
leading O
malaria B-DIS
researchers O
. O

" O
The O
parasite O
will O
be O
able O
to O
grow O
but O
it O
' O
ll O
be O
in O
a O
lower O
concentration O
of O
drug O
, O
not O
enough O
to O
kill O
it O
, O
but O
enough O
to O
enable O
it O
to O
get O
used O
to O
that O
level O
of O
drug O
and O
therefore O
it O
makes O
it O
more O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
develop O
resistance O
to O
that O
drug O
. O
" O

That O
is O
a O
huge O
problem O
when O
there O
are O
not O
that O
many O

working O
well O
against O
malaria B-DIS

Not O

Dr O
Newton O
says O
in O
order O
to O
trace O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
counterfeit O
drugs O
, O
his O
study O
looked O
at O
their O
pollen O
content O

chemistry O
make O
up O
and O
have O
handed O
this O
information O
onto O
authorities O
. O

" O
We O
' O
ve O
been O
using O
that O
information O
to O
inform O

they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
their O

" O
he O
said O

" O
That O
work O
is O

done O

it O
has O
succeeded O
in O
cutting O
at O

some O
of O
the O

in O
South O
East O

. O
" O

The O
counterfeit O
drug O
market O
is O
difficult O
to O
control O
in O
many O
African O
and O
Asian O
countries O
because O
pharmaceutical O
medicines O
are O
not O
distributed O
by O

sold O

not O

the O

is O
on O
the O
rise O
. O

" O
The O
reason O
it O
' O

on O
the O

is O
as O

10 O
years O

received O
a O

that O
sent O
him O

The O
young O

The O

was O
part O
of O
a O
team O
that O
published O
a O

this O

exploring O
the O
link O
between O

factors O
such O
as O

, O
and O
inflammatory O
bowel B-DIS

. O

The O
researchers O
combed O
through O
thousands O
of O
international O
research O
reports O
from O
the O
past O
50 O
years O
. O

They O
found O
that O
not O

are O
cases O
of O
the O
disease I-DIS
on O
the O
rise O
, O
Canada O
has O
one O
of O
the O

The O

Kaplan O
said O

" O
The O
fascinating O
part O
about O
that O

it O
starts O
to O
give O
us O
some O

that O
might O
increase O
the O

" O
he O
said O

Genetics O
can O
make O
a O
person O
more O
susceptible O
to O
the O
ailment O
, O
but O
other O
factors O
including O
a O
fast O
food O

and O
increasingly O
sterile O

could O
be O
behind O
the O
growing O

, O

Kaplan O
. O

Today O
' O
s O
era O
of O
antibacterial O
wipes O
and O
overall O
improved O
attention O
to O

have O
helped O
eradicate O
some O

' O
t O
primed O
the O

include O
more O

for O

Kaplan O

build O
a O

for O

It O
' O

a O
goal O
Rievaj O
hopes O
is O
realized O
in O

Rievaj O
was O

aiming O
to O
make O
the O
national O

and O
try O
out O
for O
the O

when O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
resume O

, O
but O
eventually O
had O
to O
give O
up O
the O
sport O
to O
try O
to O
control O
symptoms O
of O
the O
disease I-DIS
, O
which O
most O
often O
strikes O
young O

. O

" O

all O

the O

is O
that O

Deaths O
from O
the O

have O
been O
falling O
steadily O
since O
around O

Only O
a O
few O
years O

it O
was O
said O
that O
the O

one O

figure O
on O

By O
2009 O
the O
estimate O
was O
down O
to O
one O

45 O

" O
It O
is O

He O
explained O
some O
statistical O
factors O

at O

the O

Updates O
in O
surveillance O
numbers O
in O
recent O
years O
has O
also O
led O
to O
a O
fall O
in O
the O
global O
estimate O
of O
cases O
. O

Assessing O
the O
burden O
of O
malaria B-DIS
is O
not O
straightforward O
. O

Many O
Africa O
countries O
do O
not O
have O
strong O
disease O
surveillance O
systems O
so O
cause O
of O
death O
data O
is O
not O

This O
means O
that O
surveys O
and O
what O
are O
called O
' O

descriptions O
of O

given O
by O

difficulties O
in O

the O
statistics O
, O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
, O
and O

downward O
trend O
in O

. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O

655,000 O
people O
in O
2010 O
, O
compared O
to O
800,000 O
in O
2004 O
. O

When O
I O
began O
working O
in O
the O
malaria B-DIS

in O

we O
were O

Spraying O
the O
walls O
of O

with O

is O
another O
effective O
means O
of O
reducing O
malaria B-DIS

Once O

it O
is O

that O

, O

as O

dilemma O
that O
will O
be O
a O
focus O
of O
the O
WHO O
' O

executive O
board O
next O
week O
. O

LIVE O
OR O
INACTIVATED O
At O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
issue O
are O
oral O
polio B-DIS
vaccines O
, O
which O
are O
highly O
effective O
and O
owe O
much O
of O
their O
success O
to O
the O
fact O
they O
are O
cheap O
, O
easy O
to O
deliver O
and O
contain O
live O
polio B-DIS
virus O
strains O
. O

Because O
type O
2 O
has O
already O
been O
eliminated O
, O
a O
three O
strain O
oral O
vaccine O
called O
tOPV O
is O
being O
phased O
out O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
bivalent O
or O
two O
strain O
one O
called O
bOPV O
which O
fights O
type O
1 O
and O
type O
3 O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
remains O
that O
the O
viruses O
are O
live O
. O

" O
Looking O
to O
the O
future O
we O
clearly O
want O
to O
get O
away O
from O
using O
oral O
polio B-DIS
vaccine O
( O
OPV O
) O
altogether O
because O
with O
OPV O
we O
continue O
to O
be O
putting O
live O
viruses O
into O
people O
and O
into O
the O
environment O

Certification O

Polio O
Eradication O

Britain O
' O
s O
director O
of O

Bari O
described O
it O
as O
a O
tipping O
point O
. O

" O
When O
the O
risks O
from O
the O
vaccine O
start O
to O
outweigh O
the O
risks O
from O
the O
wild O
virus O
, O
that O
' O
s O
when O
we O
should O
make O
the O
decision O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

There O
is O
an O
alternative O
called O
inactivated O
polio B-DIS
vaccine O
or O
IPV O
, O
but O
unlike O
OPV O
it O
' O
s O
expensive O
to O
make O
and O
difficult O
to O
deliver O
because O
it O
has O
to O
be O
injected O
by O
trained O
health O
workers O
in O
clinics O
. O

Most O
wealthy O
countries O
, O
like O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Britain O
, O
dealt O
with O
the O
issue O
by O
using O
oral O
polio B-DIS
vaccines O
to O
stop O
transmission O
and O
maintain O
that O
halt O
, O
then O
switching O
to O
inactivated O
polio B-DIS
vaccines O
when O
they O
were O
sure O
they O
had O
the O
virus O
beaten O
, O
Bari O
said O

For O
poorer O
countries O
with O
limited O
health O
services O
, O
infrastructure O
and O
resources O
, O
that O
won O
' O
t O
be O
so O
easy O
, O
so O
research O
teams O
are O
looking O
at O
ways O
of O
trying O
to O
make O
IPV O
more O
accessible O
. O

One O
option O
is O
to O
lower O
the O
amount O
of O
antigen O
needed O
in O
the O
vaccine O
by O
adding O
an O
adjuvant O
, O
or O
booster O
, O
that O
would O
be O
cheaper O
. O

Another O
might O
be O
developing O
a O
way O
of O
injecting O
only O
into O
the O
skin O
, O
rather O
than O
under O
it O
, O
a O
method O
that O
would O
require O
a O
lower O
and O
therefore O
cheaper O
IPV O
dose O
. O

have O
developed O
a O
very O
simple O
process O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
artemisinin O
, O
the O
active O
ingredient O
that O
pharmaceutical O
companies O
could O
only O
obtain O
from O
plants O
up O
to O
now O
. O

The O
chemists O
use O
a O
waste O
product O
from O
current O
artemisinin O
production O
as O
their O
starting O
substance O
. O

This O
substance O
can O
also O
be O
produced O
biotechnologically O
in O
yeast O
, O
which O
the O
scientists O
convert O
into O
the O
active O
ingredient O
using O
a O
simple O
yet O
very O
ingenious O
method O
. O

There O
is O
an O
effective O
treatment O
against O
malaria B-DIS
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
accessible O
to O
all O
of O
the O
more O
than O
200 O
million O
people O
worldwide B-LOC
who O
are O
affected O
by O
the O
disease O
. O

Millions O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
developing O
world O
, O
cannot O
afford O
the O
combination O
drug O
preparation O
, O
which O
consists O
mainly O
of O
artemisinin O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
price O
for O
the O
medication O
varies O
, O
as O
this O
substance O
is O
isolated O
from O
sweet O
wormwood O
( O
Artemisia O
annua O
) O
which O
grows O
mainly O
in O
China O
and O
Vietnam O
, O
and O
varies O
seasonally O
in O
its O
availability O
. O

To O
make O
the O
drug O
affordable O
for O
at O
least O
some O
patients O
in O
developing O
countries O
, O
the O
Clinton O
Foundation O
, O
for O
example O
, O
subsidises O
its O
cost O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
several O
million O
dollars O
per O
year O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
over O
one O
million O
people O
die O
of O
malaria B-DIS
each O
year O
because O
they O
do O
not O
have O
access O
to O

This O
may O
be O
about O
to O

Potsdam O
and O
Professor O
of O
Chemistry O
at O
the O
Freie O
Universität O
Berlin O
and O
his O
colleague O
François O
Lévesque O
have O
discovered O
a O
very O
simple O
way O
of O
synthesising O
the O
artemisinin O
molecule O
, O
which O
is O
known O
as O
an O
anti O
malaria B-DIS
drug O
from O
traditional O
Chinese O
medicine O
and O
has O
an O
extremely O
complex O
chemical O
structure O
. O

" O
The O
production O
of O
the O
drug O
is O
therefore O
no O
longer O
dependent O
on O
obtaining O
the O
active O
ingredient O
from O
plants O
, O
" O
says O
Peter O
Seeberger O
. O

Synthesis O
from O
a O
by O
product O
of O
artemisinin O
production O
As O
a O
starting O
point O
, O
the O
chemists O
use O
artemisinic O
acid O
" O
a O
substance O
produced O
as O
a O
hitherto O
unused O
by O
product O
from O
the O
isolation O
of O
artemisinin O
from O
sweet O
wormwood O
, O
which O
is O
produced O
in O
volumes O
ten O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
active O
ingredient O
itself O
. O

Moreover O
, O
artemisinic O
acid O
can O
easily O
be O
produced O
in O
genetically O
modified O
yeast O
as O
it O
has O
a O
much O
simpler O
structure O
. O

" O
We O
convert O
the O
artemisinic O
acid O
into O
artemisinin O
in O
a O
single O
step O
, O
" O
says O
Peter O
Seeberger O
. O

" O
And O
we O
have O
developed O
a O
simple O
apparatus O
for O
this O
process O
, O
which O
enables O
the O
production O
of O
large O
volumes O
of O
the O
substance O
under O
very O
controlled O
conditions O
. O

" O
The O
only O
reaction O
sequence O
known O
up O
to O
now O
required O
several O
steps O
, O
following O
each O
of O
which O
the O
intermediate O
products O
had O
to O
be O
isolated O
laboriously O
" O
a O
method O
that O
was O
far O
too O
expensive O
to O
offer O
as O
a O
viable O
alternative O
to O
the O
production O
of O
the O
drug O
from O
plants O
. O

The O
striking O
simplification O
of O
artemisinin O
synthesis O
required O
not O
only O
a O
keen O
sense O
for O
an O
elegant O
combination O
of O
the O
correct O
partial O
reactions O
to O
enable O
the O
process O
to O
take O
place O
in O
a O
single O
step O
; O
it O
also O
took O
a O
degree O
of O
courage O
, O
as O
the O
chemists O
departed O
from O
the O
paths O
typically O
taken O
by O
industry O
up O
to O
now O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
the O
molecule O
, O
which O
not O
only O
targets O
malaria B-DIS
but O
possibly O
also O
other O
infections O
and O
even O
breast O
cancer O
, O
is O
due O
to O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
a O
very O
reactive O
chemical O
group O
formed O
by O
two O

However O
, O
the O

has O
not O
used O
it O
to O
date O
because O
it O
was O
so O
difficult O
to O
control O
and O

on O
a O
large O
scale O
, O
" O
explains O
Peter O
Seeberger O
. O

In O
the O
large O
reaction O
vessels O
with O
which O
industrial O
manufacturers O
work O
, O
flashes O
of O
light O
do O
not O
penetrate O
deeply O
enough O
from O
outside O
and O
the O
reactive O
form O
of O
oxygen O
is O
not O
produced O
in O
sufficient O
volumes O
. O

The O
Potsdam O
based O
scientists O
have O
succeeded O
in O
resolving O
this O
problem O
using O
an O
ingenious O
trick O
: O
They O
channel O
the O
reaction O
mixture O
containing O
all O
of O
the O
required O
ingredients O
through O
a O
thin O
tube O
that O
they O
have O
wrapped O
around O
a O
UV O
lamp O
. O

In O
this O
structure O
, O
the O
light O
penetrates O
the O
entire O
reaction O
medium O
and O
triggers O
the O
chemical O
conversion O
process O
with O
optimum O
efficiency O
. O

" O
The O
fact O
that O
we O
do O
not O
carry O
out O
the O
synthesis O
as O
a O
one O
pot O
reaction O
in O
a O
single O
vessel O
, O
but O
in O
a O
continuous O
flow O
reactor O
enables O
us O
to O
define O
the O
reaction O
conditions O
down O
to O
the O
last O
detail O
, O
" O
explains O
Peter O
Seeberger O
. O

After O
just O
four O
and O
a O
half O
minutes O
a O
solution O
flows O
out O
of O
the O
tube O
, O
in O
which O
40 O
percent O
of O
the O
artemisinic O
acid O
has O
become O
artemisinin O
. O

" O
We O
assume O
that O
800 O
of O
our O
simple O
photoreactors O
would O
suffice O
to O
cover O
the O
global O
requirement O
for O
artemisinin O
, O
" O
says O
Peter O
Seeberger O
. O

And O
it O
could O
all O
happen O
very O
quickly O
. O

Peter O
Seeberger O
estimates O
that O
the O
innovative O
synthesis O
process O
could O
be O
ready O
for O
technical O
use O
in O
a O
matter O
of O
six O
months O
. O

This O
would O
alleviate O
the O
global O
shortage O
of O
artemisinin O
and O
exert O
considerable O
downward O
pressure O
on O
the O
price O
of O
